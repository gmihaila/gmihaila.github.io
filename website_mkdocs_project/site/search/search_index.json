Use imdb movie reviews dataset and see how positive-negative sentiments can be used to find other sentiments. Use Tensorflow 2, Word Embeddings, Contextual Embeddings. We\u2019ll do clustering and find best number of cluster in data we don\u2019t know anything about. We\u2019ll do pretty plots to interpret results! We\u2019ll do all this on our UNT Talon Supercomputer!

How do you load a text file, how do you \u2018clean\u2019 it, how do you make use of it? We will learn all that and at the end you will build a Neural Network model that can predict a sentiment of a Movie Review. All this on Talon! Duration: 1 Hour 15 Minutes Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Talon \u00b6 Info | Slides may 1, 2019 | University of North Texas DP F223 Hands on work on Talon UNT HPC This workshop will go over some basic instruction about Python and Jupyter Notebooks. We will learn how to see what libraries we have available and how to install your own.Learn how to create a virtual environment, and most exciting build a simple Neural Network model to predict diabetes!
