## Summary

**Interest areas:** Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Big Data, Scaling Machine Learning, Parallel Processing.

**Main Research areas:** 
Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing

**Thesis project:** 
*Casual Dialog Generation with different personas*. 
For example, imagine a chatbot from the TV Series Friends that talks like your favorite character (Joey, Chandler etc.)

**Key Assets:**

* Being a PhD student set me up to work with **little guidance** and being **self-taught**.
* **How I like to takle problems:** always start small and with good understating of the problem, build something simple that works and keep adding and testing on that until reaching the goal.
