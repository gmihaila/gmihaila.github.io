# About me üí¨

## How did I end up here?

* Neural networks are the reason I started my PhD in computer science. 
* The professor I talked with asked me if I wanted to work on natural language processing and neural networks. 
* The notion of neural networks sounded very exciting to me. 
* That‚Äôs when I knew **that** is what I wanted to do for my career.

# About me üí¨

## In my free time

* I like to share my knowledge on NLP: I wrote tutorials from scratch on state-of-the-art language models like Bert and GPT2 with over 10k views. Check them out [here](https://gmihaila.medium.com).
* Contribute to open-source ‚Äì Hugging Face `Transformers` and `Datasets`.
* Technical reviewer for one of the first books published on transformers models for NLP. The book is called **Transformers for NLP in Python**, by *Denis Rothman*.
* Technical reviewer for the next edition of the **Transformers for NLP in Python** book.
* I like to be involved in various talks and presentations around AI/ML/NLP.
* My personal project [ML Things](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things) for things I find useful and speed up my work with ML.
