# **:newspaper: Resume [ `pdf` ](George_Mihaila_Resume.pdf)**



## **:zap: Summary**

**How I got here?**

* Neural networks are the reason I started my PhD in computer science. 
* The professor I talked asked me if I wanted to work on natural language processing and neural network. 
* The notion of neural networks sounded very exciting to me. 
* That’s when I knew **that** is what I want to do for my career.

**Interest areas:** `Neural Networks`, `Deep Learning`, `Natural Language Processing`, `Reinforcement Learning`, `Computer Vision`,
`Scaling Machine Learning`.

**Research:** 

* My main research area is in NLP with focus on dialogue generation with persona. 
* I use the Friends TV corpus to train language models that can capture each of the main six characters personas. 
* Imagine a chatbot that sounds like Joey or Chandler. 
* This will make chatbots systems more engaging and allow shifting personas depending on a customer's mood which significantly increases customer experience.

**In my free time:**

* I like to share my knowledge on NLP: I write tutorials from scratch on state-of-the-art language models like Bert and GPT2 with over 10k views. Check them out [here](https://gmihaila.medium.com).
* Contribute to open-source software on GitHub – Hugging Face Transformer and Dataset library.
* Technical reviewer for one of the first books published on transformers models for NLP. The book is called Transformers for NLP in Python, by Denis Rothman.
* Most recently I was invited to be a technical reviewer for the next edition of the Transforms for NLP book.
* I delivered a webinar on my tutorial **GPT2 for Text Classification** with 300+ participants and 50 of them requested me to publish more on this topic.
