Use imdb movie reviews dataset and see how positive-negative sentiments can be used to find other sentiments. Use Tensorflow 2, Word Embeddings, Contextual Embeddings. We'll do clustering and find best number of cluster in data we don't know anything about. We'll do pretty plots to interpret results! We'll do all this on our UNT Talon Supercomputer! Duration: 1 Hour 15 Minutes Intro to using Git Lab Info | Slides may 3, 2019 | University of North Texas DP F285 How to use UNT HPC GitLab server Ever wondered what is Git and why every software company uses it? We'll teach some basic commands in Git Lab (platform used in almost every software company). And Yes, UNT has a Git Lab! Duration: 1 Hour 15 Minutes Intro to Word Embeddings - NLP Tools on Talon Info | Slides may 2, 2019 | University of North Texas DP F223 Natural Language Processing on Talon HPC Ever wondered or curious about natural language processing? How do you load a text file, how do you 'clean' it, how do you make use of it? We will learn all that and at the end you will build a Neural Network model that can predict a sentiment of a Movie Review. All this on Talon! Duration: 1 Hour 15 Minutes Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Talon Info | Slides may 1, 2019 | University of North Texas DP F223 Hands on work on Talon UNT HPC This workshop will go over some basic instruction about Python and Jupyter Notebooks. We will learn how to see what libraries we have available and how to install your own.Learn how to create a virtual environment, and most exciting build a simple Neural Network model to predict diabetes!
